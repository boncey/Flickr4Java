<p>This is a Java API which wraps the REST-based Flickr API
(information available at http://www.flickr.com/services/api/).</p>

<p>This API has been tested with JDK 1.4.</p>

<p>To use the API just construct a instance of the class
com.aetreion.flickr.Flickr and request the interfaces which you need
to work with.  For example, to send a test ping to the Flickr service:</p>

<pre>String apiKey = YOUR_API_KEY
Flickr f = new Flickr(apiKey);
TestInterface testInterface = f.getTestInterface();
Collection results = testInterface.echo(Collections.EMPTY_LIST);
</pre>

<p>An API key is required to use this API.  You should contact Flickr to
acquire an API key.  More information is available at:
http://www.flickr.com/services/api/</p>
